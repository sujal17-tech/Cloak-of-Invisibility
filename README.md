# Cloak of Invisibility

## Project Overview
The **Cloak of Invisibility** is a cutting-edge project inspired by the magical world of Harry Potter. Using advanced techniques in computer vision and optical camouflage, this project creates the illusion of invisibility by blending the wearer seamlessly into the background. 


## Technologies Used
- **OpenCV:** For computer vision and image processing.
- **Python:** The primary programming language for implementation.
- **Green Screen Effect:** Core technique for creating the invisibility illusion.

## How It Works
1. **Background Capture:** The system captures the background image without the cloak.
2. **Cloak Detection:** The software identifies the cloak using color-based masking.
3. **Camouflage:** The detected area of the cloak is replaced with the background image, creating the invisibility effect.

## Hardware Requirements
- A computer with a webcam.
- A cloak made of a specific color (preferably green or red) for color masking.
- Adequate lighting for optimal performance.

## Software Requirements
- Python 3.8 or later.
- OpenCV library.
- Numpy library.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cloak-of-invisibility.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cloak-of-invisibility
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the project:
   ```bash
   python cloak.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Place the cloak in front of the camera.
2. Ensure the background is static and well-lit.
3. Watch as the cloak blends seamlessly with the background, creating the invisibility illusion.

## Future Enhancements
- Support for dynamic backgrounds.
- Improved detection algorithms for varied lighting conditions.
- Integration with wearable technology for enhanced realism.

## Acknowledgments
- Inspired by the Harry Potter series.
